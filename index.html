            <h2>The History of the Internet</h2>
            <p>The internet made a huge difference in the world, with it people have access to information times easier
                than before. Internet can be resumed as a mean of
                communication and a good way to spread information throughout the world as soon as it does’t have
                geographical locations limits. It was originally created
                during the cold war to communicate computers that had important and private data of the United States
                of America and it’s first name was ARPANET.
                The history of, as the human history (before and after christ), can be divided in two different
                periods, before the world wide web (www) and after that. </p>

                    <p>As said before, the internet before the world wide web was mainly for important secret
                        information storage during the cold war, with the end of the cold
                        war the american government allowed the universities to explore part of the internet with the
                        condition that they would still collaborating with the data
                        defense technology. In that time, internet was an almost entirely text-based world and the
                        communication was based on TCP/IP protocols, which works in a
                        client/server model of communication, a user machine (client) is provided a service by another
                        computer (server) in the network. In that time, all the
                        services that the computer could provide had to be typed to the computer different from the
                        model that people know in 2018 where you can use a mouse or
                        even the touch screen of a smartphone to perform it’s functions. (Image Source:

                    <h3>After the world wide web</h3>
                    <img class="systems" src="img/opsys.jpg" alt="there's operating systems picture here">
                    <p>With the creation of the world wide web by Tim Berners-Lee (a British computer scientist born in
                        London) everything has changed in the virtual world and it
                        has improved substantially until it reached the web as it is known nowadays and it still
                        improving faster than can be seen by people. The computers now
                        have interfaces and can be used easily by users, it has turned them to spread worldwide with
                        people that need or like to use them. The way that the world
                        wide web works is based in three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s
                        web. Those are HTML (HyperText Markup Language) that is
                        the formatting language for the web, URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) this is a kind of
                        “address” that is unique and used to identify to reach resource
                        the web, and the HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) which allows for the retrieval of linked
                        resources from across the web. With that, the early web
                        community produced some revolutionary ideas that are now spreading even in other sectors that
                        are not technology, those ideas are Decentralisation,
                        Non-discrimination, Bottom-up design, Universality and Consensus. (Image Source:

            <div class="languages">
                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>HTML is one of the computer languages used to website creation. The websites that are created with
                    it can give the rights for anyone connected to the
                    internet to access it. It is considered easy to learn since it is a basic language and quite
                    powerful in what it can do. It consists in a series of
                    short codes typed into a text-file by the site author. This text will be saved in a HTML file and
                    can be accessed through a browser (such as Google Chrome
                    or Internet Explorer). This browser will be responsible for reading and translating this text into
                    a visible form and hopefully it will render the page in
                    the way that the author of the code intended to show. HTML websites can be created from any text
                    editor from the Notepad or even Brackets IDE as soon as
                    the file is saved as a HTML file. </p>

                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>Css is an acronym that stands for Cascading Style Sheets, it is a simple design language that
                    intends to simplify the process of creating web pages
                    presentable. It handles the look and feel part of the web page. With the use of CSS, the color of
                    the text, the style of the fonts, the space between
                    paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what colors or background images are used, the
                    design of the layout, responsiveness (how will be the
                    behaviour of the website in different screens or monitor’s size) can be controlled and manipulated
                    in the way that the web site creator wants the web
                    page to look like. It is easy to learn and has a powerful control over the presentation of a HTML
                    document. In most of the cases, it is combined with
                    the markup languages HTML or XHTML.</p>

                <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
                <p> JavaScript, also known as JS is a programming language that runs on the web. It is supported by all
                    the famous browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox,
                    Safari and etc) and mobile browsers for phones support it too. It is primarily used to enhance web
                    pages to give a better experience to users. These
                    include dynamically web pages updates, user interface enhancements such as dialog boxes, menus,
                    animations, 3D and 2D graphics, interactive maps,
                    and more. It is usually used with HTML and CSS, the combination of the three results in “The Web
                    Page Triad”.</p>
                <img id="triad" src="img/triad.png" alt="There's the Website's Triad here">
                <p id="last">With the web page triad most of the websites can be developed from blogs or portals or
                    even
                    e-commerce, all of them can be build with those three
                    languages.</p>
